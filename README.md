Suger Gif Capture
=================

Chrome plugin for generating easily and in a few clicks an animated gif from the selected content of a page. Sometimes a screenshot is not enough.

How it works:
-------------

* Push the extension button and choose the capture area
* Wait until you are ready for generating the gif
* Push the button again, now you will see the percentage process of the git generation over it.
* When it finishes the extension will open a new tab showing the gif and allowing you to download it.

Settings:
------------
* By default the gifs will have 15 seconds as maximum length, a FPS value (frames per second) of 5 and a quality of 50.
* All this settings can be modified using your right mouse button over the extension icon and choosing "Options".

Instalation:
------------

### From the chrome web store:

Go to [Super Gif Capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-gif-capture/algmheobonijciecgfbapkhoonnhlnpe) in the Chrome web store and click install.

### From the source code:

Credits:
--------
